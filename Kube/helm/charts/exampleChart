Convert the Service Manifest into a Service Template in a New Helm Chart
On the first console, create a blob directory called blog:

mkdir blog
Access the directory:

cd blog
Run the touch and mkdir commands to create the minimum necessary scaffolding for the new chart. This includes the Chart.yaml and values.yaml files as well as the templates directory:

touch Chart.yaml
touch values.yaml
mkdir templates
View the chart details:

ls -l
Create the Chart.yaml file:

vim Chart.yaml
Add the apiVersion, name, and version to the file (this is the minimum data required for Chart.yaml):

apiVersion: v1
name: blog
version: 0.1.0
Save and exit the file.

Create the values.yaml file:

vim values.yaml
On the second console, view the home directory, which contains a kubernetes directory:

ls
Run the cd and ls commands to open and view the kubernetes directory. The directory contains an application.yaml file and a service.yaml file:

$ cd kubernetes/
ls
View service.yaml:

vim service.yaml
On the first console, use the data from service.yaml to add data to values.yaml. Update nodePort to 30080:

service:
 name: blog
 type: NodePort
 port: 80
 targetPort: 2368
 nodePort: 30080
On the first console, save values.yaml.

On the second console, exit out of service.yaml.

On the second console, run the cd command to open the blog folder and run the vim command to view the values.yaml file:

cd ../blog
vim ./values.yaml
On the first console, open the templates directory:

cd templates/
Copy the service.yaml file into the blog folder's templates directory:

cp ~/kubernetes/service.yaml ./
Run the ls and vim commands to view service.yaml.

ls service.yaml
vim service.yaml
Use the values.yaml data on the second console to make service.yaml a template on the first console. To do this, update the service.yaml file values as follows:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
    name: {{ .Values.service.name }}
spec:
    type: {{ .Values.service.type }}
    selector:
        app: {{ .Values.service.name }}
    ports:
    -   protocol: TCP
        port: {{ .Values.service.port }}
        targetPort: {{ .Values.service.targetPort }}
        nodePort: {{ .Values.service.nodePort }}
On the first console, save the template to return to the templates directory.

On the second console, exit out of values.yaml to return to the blog folder.

On the first console, run the cd and helm show values commands to view the blog details. At this point, we have a full Helm chart:

cd ~/
helm show values blog
Verify the manifest's syntax is correct:

helm install demo blog --dry-run
On the second console, run the cd and cat commands so you can compare the two service.yaml files.

cd ../
cat ./kubernetes/service.yaml
Confirm the service.yaml data matches on the first and second consoles, with the exception of the nodePort value.

After reviewing the service.yaml data, clear both consoles.

clear
Convert the Manifest for the Application into a Deployment Template in a New Helm Chart
On the second console, view the application.yaml file:

vim ./kubernetes/application.yaml
On the first console, view the blog folder's values.yaml file:

vim ./blog/values.yaml
Below the existing file data, create a new blog section by inserting the following values. You can copy these values from the second console:

blog:
  name: blog
  replicas: 1
  image: ghost:2.6-alpine
  imagePullPolicy: Always
  containerPort: 2368
On the second console, exit out of the chart.

On the first console, save the values file.

On the second console, view the blog folder's values.yaml file:

vim ./blog/values.yaml
On the first console, copy the kubernetes folder's application.yaml file into the blog folder's templates directory:

cp ./kubernetes/application.yaml ./blog/templates/
View the application.yaml file in the blog folder's templates directory:

vim ./blog/templates/application.yaml
Make application.yaml a template by updating the file values as follows:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: {{ .Values.blog.name }}
  labels:
    app: {{ .Values.blog.name}}
spec:
  replicas: {{ .Values.blog.replicas }}
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: {{ .Values.blog.name }}
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: {{ .Values.blog.name }}
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: {{ .Values.blog.name }}
        image: {{ .Values.blog.image }}
        imagePullPolicy: {{ .Values.blog.imagePullPolicy }}
        ports:
        - containerPort: {{ .Values.blog.containerPort }}
After updating the file values, save the template and clear the console:

clear
On the second console, exit out of the values.yaml file.

Ensure the Manifests Render Correctly and Deploy the Application as a NodePort Application
On the first console, run the helm show values command to view the blog folder's details:

helm show values blog
Run the helm install command with the --dry-run directive. The manifest should display with the service set to run as a NodePort on port 30080 (in the lab video, this step produced an error message because there was a typo in the application.yaml file):

helm install demo blog --dry-run
Install and deploy Helm:

helm install demo blog
View the pod details (note that the pod's status is ContainerCreating):

kubectl get po
While the container is being created, view the service details (note that the blog service is running on the correct NodePort of 30080):

kubectl get svc
Verify the pod's status is now Running:

kubectl get po
